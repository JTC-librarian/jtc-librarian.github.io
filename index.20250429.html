    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>I am the Systems and Discovery Manager at Solent University Library in Southampton, UK. As well as being a librarian, I am a keen hiker and an amateur classicist. 
      I live in Southampton with my wife Catherine, a <a href="http://www.catherineherriott.co.uk/">
        professional pianist</a> whom I met through a London-based <a href="https://www.metropolitan-walkers.org.uk/">walking club</a>. Our son Nicholas was
        born in 2021.</p>
    <h2>Librarianship</h2>
    <p>At Solent I am a member of the Library Management Team and I have ultimate responsibility for the Cataloguing & Metadata and the Digitization & Reading List
      teams. I serve as the library's Systems Librarian, which is probably the most time-consuming part of my role, and lead the library on copyright policy.
      I have previously worked in metadata and/or systems at Durham University, King's College London, and University College London. I am interested in making things 
      easier for librarians, by automating routine tasks, and for library users, by improving metadata sharing, structure, and display. See my <a href="librarianship.html">librarianship page</a> for a list of my professional publications, presentations, etc.</p>
    <h2>Classics</h2>
    <p>My undergraduate degree was in Classics, that is Greek and Latin Language and Literature, and I continue to read around the subject. My greatest interest is 
      in Greek tragedy, in trying to understand how it worked both formally and in its effect on the original audience. I have found Malcolm Heath's <i>The Poetics
      of Greek Tragedy</i> and Oliver Taplin's <i>The Stagecraft of Aeschylus</i> particularly valuable. I have published several articles on tragedy myself, each one
      dealing either with stage action or the sound of tragedy. They all work in the same way: I identify a pattern that is unlikely to have occurred by chance and 
      draw the natural conclusions. See my <a href="publications.html">classics publications page</a> for a list of these articles.</p>
